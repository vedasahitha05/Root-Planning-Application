# Route-Planning-Application
Developed a Metro Route Optimization System in Java, utilizing graph data structures and Dijkstraâ€™s
algorithm for efficient pathfinding. Enabled users to explore metro networks, find optimal routes based on distance
and time constraints, and provided an interactive interface for easy navigation. Incorporated station codes for user
convenience and accurately detected interchange stations. Outputted optimized paths in a clear format, displaying
starting station, intermediate stops, and destination, along with total distance or time for the journey
